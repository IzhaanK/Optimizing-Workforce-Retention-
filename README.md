# Optimizing-Workforce-Retention-Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics
Employee turnover is a critical challenge for Company X, costing approximately 20% of an employee’s salary to hire a replacement, not to mention significant losses in productivity and time. In response, the HR department has provided data on both current employees and those who have left the organization. They seek insights into the reasons behind employee attrition and, crucially, a predictive model to identify employees likely to leave.

## Understanding Employee Attrition
Employee attrition occurs when an individual leaves the company for any reason and is not replaced for an extended period, if at all. This includes voluntary resignations, layoffs, absences without return, or even departures due to illness or death.

### Types of Employee Attrition:

Voluntary Attrition: When an employee chooses to leave on their own, for reasons that may or may not be under the organization’s control.
Involuntary Attrition: When the company decides to part ways with an employee, often due to role elimination, reorganization, or poor performance. For example, when a position is eliminated, it is often not backfilled, making this the most common form of involuntary attrition.
Monitoring organizational health with key HR metrics is essential, as attrition can have severe financial consequences. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the annual turnover rate in the U.S. in 2017 was 26.3%. The cost of replacing an employee can range from half to double their annual salary. For instance, in a 100-person organization with an average salary of $50,000, turnover costs could range from $660,000 to $2.6 million per year.

Alarmingly, 52% of employees who leave voluntarily believe that their organization or manager could have done something to prevent their departure. Furthermore, 51% report that, in the three months prior to leaving, no one from management discussed job satisfaction or future prospects with them.

Clearly, attrition is a major issue that requires targeted solutions.

## Project Approach
Our analysis will be conducted in three phases:

Descriptive Analytics: To understand past attrition trends and patterns.
Predictive Analytics: To forecast which employees are likely to leave based on historical data.
Prescriptive Analytics: To provide actionable recommendations that Company X can implement to improve employee retention.
Additionally, an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed to uncover key drivers and insights, forming a comprehensive strategy to address Company X’s attrition challenge.
